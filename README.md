# tc2website-flask
Hello, this is the flask implementation for tdc-2 website. Our documentation is still under development. For most matters, you can refer to theh original TDC repo.

We have developed a new more decentralized method for adding entries to TDC leaderboards. While things are still under development, we want to unblock users trying to add their entries to the leaderboard by providing the following minimalist guide.

To add your entry to the leaderboard, add your results to the corresponding leaderboard in this file
https://github.com/mims-harvard/tdc2website-flask/blob/main/benchmark/leaderboards.py
You must match the format for your leaderboard in that file. In short, the format is as follows:

1. On the fourth item of the list paired to your leaderboard, you will find a list with entries corresponding to the metadata for your entry as well as the 
mean value for the leaderboard metric. Fill out this information and add an entry to that list.

2. On the fifth item of the list paired to your leaderboard, you will find a list containing entries with the metric value and standard deviation. Add your numbers to that list.

Last, create a PR for this repo and contact @amva13 or contact@tdcommons.ai to get approval!

The PR must include the following in the description:

A. A link to the codes for training the model and running the benchmarks.
B. Instructions for replicating your results running these codes.
C. Description of the hardware used for training the model.
D. Link to paper to be included on the website
E. Paper authors and developers of the model.
F. The dictionary string output of running the TDC benchmark group evaluations.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
